                    <p>Hi, Iâ€™m Melissa, a passionate Full-Stack Developer with a strong attention for detail and design, and a drive for continuously learning and improving. I enjoy solving complex problems, creating innovative solutions and designing beautiful modern UI.</p>
                        <br></br>
                        <p className="hidden lg:block">
                        My journey in coding began during my time at university, where I studied Physics and Chemistry, using python to analyse data. From there, I began to explore coding further and discovered a strong passion for software development. Initially self-taught, I decided to take the leap into a career in tech and enrolled in the 13 week Northcoders Software Engineering bootcamp, which provided me with a solid foundation. Since then, I have been working as a Junior Software Engineer at Touchbyte, where I have been able to further develop my skills and knowledge in a professional environment.</p>
                        <br></br>
                        <p>
                        With proficiency in a range of programming languages and frameworks, I bring a versatile approach to software development. When I'm not coding, you'll find me gaming, reading or crocheting!</p>
                        <br></br>
                        <p>
                        I am excited to connect with like-minded people and take on new challenges!</p>
